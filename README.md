# Project - Workbook (Term 1)

## Question 1 - Identify and explain common and important components and concepts of web development markup languages.

Markup is used to annotate text. When markup rules become codified, it becomes a language.
Web development markup provides instructions for how the content is displayed or printed.
HTML (hypertext markup language), XML (extensible markup language), XHTML (extended hypertext markup language)
Based on SGML (standard generalized markup language)

HTML is the primary language used for web development. All modern websites will contain HTML. HTML5 is the most recent version, and any future additions to the language will be added without the need for a new version being released. HTML5 provides the most flexible rules compared to other markup languages. As HTML was developed, the language became too complicated, and there was a need to separate the web page content from the web page style. While styling can still be used in HTML, CSS (cascading style sheets) was created to contain web page style.

HTML instructs the web browser how to display or print content by labelling pieces of the content. Labelling content is done by using opening and closing tags around content. For example:

```HTML
<label>Web page content</label>
```

The core elements in HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html> initial declaration to define the document as a HTML document
<html> root element of the page
<head> contains the meta information of the page (e.g. Document title using <title> element)
<body> contains all of the displayed content of the webpage

An example of the meta information that can be contained within the document head is as follows:

```HTML

```

The body contains all displayed content on the webpage. Some of the main elements that can be defined in the body are as follows:
- Text elements
    - Headings 
    - Paragraph
-
